In an essay discussing American politics, writer George Packer centres his analysis around one particular southwestern American city.



He narrates multiple disparate tales about immigration, urban design, national politics and even university administration, but binds them all together through the issue of availability of water.



Talking about the modern origins of the city, he describes how the civilisation of the indigenous population, known today as the "Hohokam Indians", collapsed mysteriously at some point in the 15th century.



Four hundred years later, when white settlers reached the territory, they found the ruins of abandoned canals, cleared them out with shovels, and built crude weirs of trees and rocks to push water back into the desert.



The name specifically chosen reflected the intended revitalisation of an old city: "Aware of a lost civilization in the Valley, they named the new settlement _______."
